- 👋 Hi, I’m @RenierNaidoo
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, specifically in back-end development and blockchain development. I am always eager to learn new topics and fields, however.
- 🌱 I’m currently completing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (Just six more months!).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects where I can learn more about the demands of the workplace beyond the theoretical and practical work of an 
      academic environment.
- 📫 How to reach me: r.naidoo1111@gmail.com
